# Entropy

System with many states.

Group states.

Continuous systems are tricky.

Justify phase-space volume.

Entropy measures the size of a group. It's logarithmic so it's extensive.

# Microcanonical ensemble

Argument:
1. The dynamics of the system induce a distribution on the phase space, by
   visitation frequency.
2. This distribution is stationary
3. By Liouville's theorem, the distribution is constant along the trajectories
   of the system
4. You get a constant PDF on every reachable point.

A subtlety to iron out: The delta functions induced by conserved quantities.

Relatedly, integrable systems divide into multiple mutually unreachable parts,
because of the many conserved quantities.

By definition, time averages are equal to statistical averages.

Make subgroups, for example by number of particles on each side of a box. The
entropy of a subgroup is the log of its size. This is a special case of
Shannon's entropy. It's logarithmic so it's extensive.

The size of a subgroup is the phase space volume.

The largest subgroups dominate the probability distribution.

To first order, entropy is maximized, Then there are fluctations.

Because of time-reversal symmetry, entropy most likely decreases both forward
and backward in time. Which means that most points of lower entropy are minima,
instead of on the path towards higher or lower entropy. 

The universe is not at maximum entropy because it's not done yet.

# Temperature

Allow two system to exchange energy -> same dS/dE. Then dS/dE is the
temperature.

# Canonical ensemble

The canonical ensemble is a different distribution over states.

If you assume the microcanonical distribution for system + thermostat, then the
system is distributed canonically.
